        SalishSeaCast surface tracer fields, hourly, v19-05, aggregated tracer profiles,
        and HRDPS along-axis surface wind velocity and wind stress used for the analysis
        presented in B. Moore-Maley and S. E. Allen: Wind-driven upwelling and surface
        nutrient delivery in a semi-enclosed coastal sea, Ocean Sci., 2021.

        Surface water temperature and nitrate field values averaged over 1 hour intervals
        from SalishSeaCast model runs with physics, biology and chemistry. The values are
        calculated for the entire model grid that includes the Juan de Fuca Strait, the
        Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Johnstone Strait on the coasts of Washington
        State and British Columbia. The time values are UTC. They are the centre of the
        intervals over which the calculated model results are averaged.

            Along-axis wind velocity and wind stress from HRDPS are reported at the beginning of
            the hour; e.g. values corresponding to 2021-06-03 00:30:00Z were originally reported
            at 2021-06-03 00:00:00Z

            Along-axis wind velocity is calculated by rotating the HRDPS 10m meridional wind velocity
            55.5 degrees counter-clockwise from north. The spatial median is computed over the HRDPS
            grid points that cover the open water areas of the SoG with inlets and the Gulf Islands
            masked out.

            Along-axis wind stress is calculated from the HRDPS 10m wind speed and along-axis
            wind velocity according to Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983) JPO. The spatial median is
            computed over the HRDPS grid points that cover the open water areas of the SoG with
            inlets and the Gulf Islands masked out.

    profiles:
        comment: >
            Profile percentiles are calculated based on the spatial median of the 3D hourly fields
            over the NEMO grid points that cover the open water areas of the SoG with inlets and the
            Gulf Islands masked out. The percentiles are then calculated over the time dimension.
            Temporal coverage is during the productive seasons of 2015-2019 (i.e. winter and shoulder
            seasons removed).
